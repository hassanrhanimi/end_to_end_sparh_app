Title : ETL and Machine Learning with spark

In this exercice, Iâ€™ll create an Apache Spark Machine learning application as end to end use case from data acquisition, transformation, model training and deployment.

Objectives After completing reading, you will see and hopefelly be able also to:

Pull-in data from the HMP dataset here
Create a Spark data frame from the raw data
Store this to parquet (in Cloud Object Store)
Read it again (from Cloud Object Store)
Deploy this model to Train a ML-Model on that data set
Watson Machine Learning
